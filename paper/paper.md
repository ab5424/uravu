# Summary

`uravu` offers an easy to use interface to Bayesian modelling for scientific analysis in the Python programming language, making Bayesian modelling as easy to use as the `scipy.optimize.curve_fit()` method.  
This software acts to lower the barrier of entry to the use of packages such as:

- `scipy`: for maximum likelihood estimation [@virtanen_scipy_2020]
- `emcee`: for Markov chain Monte Carlo investigation of posterior probabilities [@foremanmackey_emcee_2019]
- `dynesty`: for nested sampling of the Bayesian evidence [@speagle_dynesty_2020].

In addition to lowering the entry barrier uravu also adds additional utility, such as the inclusion of measurement units (important for scientific analysis) with the `pint` package, and publication-quality plots of relationships, data, and distributions with `matplotlib` [@hunter_matplotlib_2007] and `corner` [@foremanmackey_corner_2019]. 

In addition to the straightforward interface, the `uravu` documentation offers brief tutorials (uravu.rtfd.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) in all aspects of the package.
This enables those unfamiliar with Bayesian modelling to get to grips with these important tools for data analysis.
`uravu` is being actively applied to scientific problems, such as data reduction at large scale scientific facilities and the modelling of diffusion in battery materials.

# Statement of Need

The Python language has a large number of powerful packages related to the application of Bayesian modelling. 
However, to apply these methods to their problems, scientific users need a straightforward environment. 
For maximum-likelihood modelling, this is achieved using the `scipy.optimize.curve_fit()` method for many users but, to the best of the author's knowledge, there is no equivalent method for Bayesian modelling.
`uravu` fills this gap by offering easy access to powerful Python packages to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling. 
Furthermore, the tutorials, available as documentation, online allow users to become more comfortable with the use of Bayesian methods for data modelling.
